        <p>The 1987 Cricket World Cup (also known as the Reliance World Cup
for sponsorship reasons) was the fourth edition of the ICC Cricket
World Cup tournament. It was held from 8 October to 8 November
1987 in India and Pakistan â€“ the first such tournament to be held
outside England. The one-day format was unchanged from the
eight-team 1983 event except for a reduction in the number of overs a
team played from 60 to 50, the current standard for all ODIs being
played outside England.</p>
<p>The competition was won, for the first time, by Australia who defeated
their arch-rivals England by seven runs in the most closely fought
World Cup final to date in Kolkata's Eden Gardens stadium. The two
host nations, India and Pakistan failed to reach the final, after both
being eliminated in the semi-finals. The West Indies failed to live up to
expectations and did not advance from the group stage.</p>
<h3>Final</h3><p>8 November 1987</p>
<p>Australia won the toss and chose to bat. David Boon (75 from 125
balls, 7 fours) top-scored for Australia, whose batsmen scored fluently.
Australia posted 253 (5 wickets, 50 overs). Mike Veletta (45 from 31
balls, 6 fours) cut loose late in the innings, as Australia scored 65 runs
from the last 6 overs of their innings. In the English reply, opener Tim
Robinson was out LBW for a first ball duck. Bill Athey (58 from 103
balls, 2 fours) top-scored, and England were almost on target,when
captain Mike Gatting (41 from 45 balls, 3 fours, 1 six) handed back the
initiative with the loss of his wicket, which ended a growing partnership
of 69 runs in 13 overs between him and Athey. Allan Lamb (45 from 55
balls, 4 fours) also posted a great innings, but it was in vain as the
required run-rate for England began to rise. When England failed to
score the last 17 runs from the final over, the cup went to Australia.</p>
<h3>format</h3>
<p>The format of the competition was two groups of four teams each team
playing each other twice in fifty-over matches. The top two teams from
each group would advance to the semi-finals where the two winners
would then advance to the final. All matches were played during
daytime and  for a final time in the event's history , saw the teams
appear in traditional white clothing and use traditional red balls.</p>
<p>The ICC decreed that all seven (eligible) countries holding Test status
would automatically qualify for the tournament; One additional entry
place would be awarded to the winners of the 1986 ICC Trophy; and
for the second time this turned out to be Zimbabwe, who defeated the
Netherlands to earn the berth.</p>

		<h3>memories</h3>
		
         <p> The 1983 Cricket World Cup (officially the Prudential World Cup) was
the 3rd edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup tournament. It was held
from 9 June to 25 June 1983 in England and Wales and was won by
India. Eight countries participated in the event. The 1983 World Cup
was full of dramatic cricket all through the tournament. Teams like
India and Zimbabwe who were not playing well during those times
scored upset victories over the West Indies and Australia respectively.
England, Pakistan, India and tournament favourites West Indies
qualified for the semi-finals. The preliminary matches were played in
two groups of four teams each, and each country played the others in
its group twice. The top two teams in each group qualified for the
semi-finals.</p>
<p>The matches consisted of 60 overs per team and were played in
traditional white clothing and with red balls. They were all played
during the day.</p>
<h3>Final</h3><p>25 June 1983</p>
<p>In the final, India lost the toss and were asked to bat first against a
West Indies team that arguably boasted the world's best bowling
attack. Only Krishnamachari Srikkanth (38 from 57 balls) and
Mohinder Amarnath (26 from 80 balls) put up any significant
resistance as Roberts, Marshall, Joel Garner and Michael Holding
ripped through the Indian batsmen, ably supported by Gomes.</p>
<p>Surprising resistance by the tail allowed India to compile 183 (all out,
54.4 overs). When Indian chips were down Kapil Dev said "team if this
is not a winning total its definitely a fighting total" One of the popular
quotes of all time. However, the Indian bowling exploited the weather
and pitch conditions perfectly to bowl out the best batting lineup of the
era for 140 from 52 overs in return, winning by 43 runs and
completing one of the most stunning upsets in cricket history.
Amarnath and Madan Lal (3-31) each took three wickets, and one
memorable moment was the sight of Kapil Dev running a great
distance (about 18-20 yards) to take a catch to dismiss Richards, the
West Indies top scorer with 33 from 28 balls. Amarnath was the most
economical bowler, conceding just 12 runs from his seven overs, while
taking 3 wickets, and was once again awarded the Man of the Match
award for his all-round performance.[3] There was no 'Man of the
Series' awarded in 1983.</p>
<h3>format</h3>
<p>The format of the 1983 World Cup was 2 groups of four teams, each
team playing each other twice. The top two teams from each group
then advanced to the semi finals with the winners further advancing to
the finals. Every game was of 60 overs with all day matches.</p>

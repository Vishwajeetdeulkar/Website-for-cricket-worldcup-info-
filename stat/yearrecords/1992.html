		<h3>memories</h3>
		
         <p>The 1992 Cricket World Cup was the fifth staging of the Cricket World
Cup, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was held
in Australia and New Zealand from 22 February to 25 March 1992, and
finished with Pakistan beating England in the final to become the World
Cup champions for the first time.</p><p>The 1992 World Cup was the first to feature coloured player clothing,
white cricket balls and black sight screens with a number of matches
being played under floodlights. The 1992 World Cup was also the
first to be held in the Southern hemisphere. It was also the first World
Cup to include the South Africa national cricket team, which had been
allowed to re-join the International Cricket Council as a Test-playing
nation after the end of apartheid.</p>
<h3>Final</h3><p>25 March 1992</p>
<p>The final began with eerie resemblances to same fixture earlier in the
tournament when England bowled out Pakistan for a paltry 74, as
Derek Pringle dismissed both Pakistani openers at 24. However, Imran
Khan and Javed Miandad settled down to see off the new ball. A crucial
moment occurred when Imran Khan was dropped by Graham Gooch at
9 runs. He later went on to score a match-winning 72. At the 25 over
mark, Pakistan had only scored 70, but accelerated the score to 139
by the 31st over as Javed Miandad summoned a runner and Imran and
him built a steady partnership. During his innings, Imran Khan hit a
huge six off Richard Illingworth that landed far back into the members
section. Imran played a captain's innings getting a score of 72 and
Miandad 58 to steady the innings, expectedly followed by an onslaught
from Inzamam (42) and Wasim Akram (33) enabling Pakistan to give
England a fighting target of 250.</p>
<p>England's start was shaky. Ian Botham was dismissed for a duck by
Wasim Akram, followed by Stewart, Hick and Gooch, which left England
tumbling at 69/4. A solid partnership of 71 between Allan Lamb and
Neil Fairbrother caused Imran to give an early second spell to his main
pacer Wasim Akram in the 35th over. The decision wrote the fate of the
match. Two deliveries from the left arm fast bowler dismissed Allan
Lamb and Chris Lewis. Soon Fairbrother was caught by Moin Khan off
Aaqib Javed to seal England's last hope. When the cards were laid
down, Captain Imran Khan had the last laugh when Richard Illingworth
was caught by Ramiz Raja off his delivery to finish off the final and
crown Pakistan World Champions of cricket.</p>
<h3>format</h3>
<p>The format was changed from previous tournaments in that a complete
round-robin replaced the use of two qualifying groups. The initial draw
was released with eight competing countries and 28 round-robin
matches. In late 1991, South Africa were re-admitted to the
International Cricket Council after long years of apartheid and the
draw was amended to include them. The revised draw included 36
round-robin matches plus the two semi-finals and the final.</p>

		<p>21 June 1975</p>
           <p>The 1975 Cricket World Cup (officially called the Prudential Cup) was
the first edition of the Cricket World Cup, organised by the
International Cricket Conference (ICC). It was held from 7 to 21 June
1975 in England.</p>
<p>The tournament was sponsored by Prudential Assurance Company and
had eight participating countries: the six Test-playing teams of the
time (Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the West
Indies), plus leading Associate nations Sri Lanka and, for the only time,
East Africa. The teams were divided into two groups of four, with each
team playing the other teams in their group once; the top two from
each group qualified for the semi-finals, with the winners of these
matches meeting in the final. Each match consisted of 60 overs per
team and was played in traditional white clothing and with red balls; all
were played during the day and hence started early.</p>
<p>England, New Zealand West Indies and Australia were the teams to
qualify for the semi-finals, making this the only World Cup thus far in
which no team from the Indian subcontinent made this stage. Australia
defeated England and the West Indies beat New Zealand, before the
West Indies, the pre-tournament favourites, defeated Australia in the
final at Lord's by 17 runs to become the first World Cup winners.</p>
<h3>Final</h3><p> 1975 Cricket World Cup Final<br />
In the final, the West Indies beat Australia by 17 runs, after an accomplished innings from captain <br />
Clive Lloyd (102 from 85 balls, 12 fours, 2 sixes).
</p>
<p> The Australian innings was marked by top-order<br />
batsmen being run out when going for runs after misfields. A total of<br />
five of their team were run out, three by Vivian Richards. There was no
'Man of the Series' awarded in 1975.<br />
</p>
<h3>format</h3>
<p>The format of the first world cup was 2 groups of four teams each, and each team playing each other.<br />
 The top two team from each group then advance to the Semi Finals, where the winners then advance (qualified)<br />
for the finals.</p>
<p>The first Cricket World Cup was played in England on seven different venues. A total of 16 matches were<br />
 played in the 1975 Cricket WorldCup, including two semi-finals and a final.</p>

        <p>The 2015 Cricket World Cup was the 11th Cricket World Cup, jointly
hosted by Australia and New Zealand from 14 February to 29 March
2015. Fourteen teams played 49 matches in 14 venues, with Australia
staging 26 games at grounds in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart,
Melbourne, Perth and Sydney while New Zealand hosted 23 games in
Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hamilton, Napier, Nelson and
Wellington.</p>
<p>The hosting rights were awarded at the same time as those of the
2011 Cricket World Cup, which Australia and New Zealand had
originally bid to host, and the 2019 Cricket World Cup, which was
awarded to England. The 2011 tournament was awarded to the four
Asian Test cricket playing countries, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and
Bangladesh (Pakistan later lost the co-hosting rights due to a terrorist
attack on the Sri Lankan team). The International Cricket Council were
sufficiently impressed with the trans-Tasman bid that it was decided to
award the next World Cup to Australia and New Zealand.This was
the second time the tournament was held in Australia and New
Zealand, with the first being the 1992 Cricket World Cup.
India were the defending champions, having won the tournament in
2011. Tickets for the Pool B match between India and Pakistan, played
on 15 February 2015, reportedly sold out within 12 minutes of going
on sale.</p>
<p>The final match of the tournament took place at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground between co-hosts New Zealand and Australia in front of a
record crowd of 93,013 while the average attendance throughout
the tournament was 21,175 resulting from the cumulative tournament
attendance of 1,016,420 and a washed out game between Australia
and Bangladesh in Brisbane for which no attendance-figures were
available. Australia defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets to win their
fifth ICC Cricket World Cup .</p>
<h3>Controversies</h3>
<p>The Pool A match between Australia and England ended when James
Anderson was run out straight after James Taylor was given out lbw.
Because Taylor's decision was reviewed and overturned, the ICC later
admitted that the ball should have been declared dead (according to
Article 3.6a of Appendix 6 of the Decision Review System Playing
Conditions), and so Anderson was incorrectly given out.</p>
<p>During the Pool B match between Ireland and Zimbabwe, Sean
Williams was caught by Ireland's John Mooney in a close run chase.
Mooney was extremely close to the boundary and eight different
television replays were inconclusive as to whether his foot had touched
the boundary rope. Meanwhile, Williams had walked and the umpires
signalled him out.</p>
<p>During the second quarter-final match between India and
Bangladesh, Rubel Hossain bowled a full toss to Rohit Sharma who was
caught at square-leg. The umpire thought the ball was too high and
declared it a no ball, meaning the batsman was not out. Replays
showed that the ball was waist height, and therefore a legal
delivery. The ICC's Bangladeshi President, Mustafa Kamal, later
questioned the integrity of the umpire and threatened to resign in
protest and Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said
India won the match because of umpiring errors. However, ICC
chief executive Dave Richardson claimed the accusations were
baseless, and based on personal feelings of an individual. He said the
incident was a 50-50 call and the decision belonged to the umpire.

         <p>The 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup was the eighth Cricket World Cup,
organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was co-hosted
by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya from 9 February to 23 March
2003. This edition of the World Cup was the first to be played in Africa.
The tournament featured 14 teams, the largest number in the World
Cup's history at the time, playing a total of 54 matches. It followed the
format introduced in the 1999 World Cup, with the teams divided into
two groups, and the top three in each group qualifying for the Super
Sixes stage.</p>
<p>The tournament saw numerous upsets, with South Africa, Pakistan,
West Indies and England all being eliminated at the group stage (South
Africa missed by 1 run after misreading the Duckworth-Lewis method
rules). England forfeited their match with Zimbabwe, due to the
political unrest in the country, which ultimately enabled that team to
reach the Super Sixes. Similarly, New Zealand forfeited their match
with Kenya, due to security reasons which enabled the latter to reach
the semi-finals, the only non-Test playing nation to do so. Another
shock wave came two days after the tournament had started, when
Shane Warne, at the time one of the game's leading spinners, was sent
home in disgrace after testing positive for a banned substance.
The tournament was eventually won by Australia who won all 11 of
their matches, beating India in the final played at the Wanderers
Stadium in Johannesburg. This was Australia's third World Cup.</p>
<p><h3>Final</h3>
<p>India won the toss, and Ganguly, elected to field, hoping to take
advantage of a pitch left damp by dew and rain. On a lively Wanderers
Stadium pitch, the Australian openers took advantage of very wayward
Indian opening bowlers to get off to a flying start. Adam Gilchrist (57
from 48 balls, 8 fours, 1 six) and Matthew Hayden (37 from 54 balls, 5
fours) shared an opening partnership of 105 runs in 14 overs, forcing
Ganguly to bring on the spinners unusually early. The change of pace
brought wickets with Adam Gilchrist, who had been swinging at
everything, holing out off a sweep shot from the bowling of Harbhajan
Singh. Matthew Hayden, looking somewhat better than he had
throughout the tournament, soon followed for 37, leaving Australia at
2/125 Captain Ricky Ponting (140 from 121 balls, 4 fours, 8 sixes) and
Damien Martyn (88 from 84 balls, 7 fours, 1 six) (playing with a broken
thumb) completing a partnership of 234 runs in 30.1 overs, an
Australian record for one-day cricket. Ponting and Martyn started
efficiently, putting away bad balls but mostly keeping the scoring going
with good running, then letting loose in the last ten overs, taking 109
from them. Ponting in particular dispatched the bowling over the fence
with fearsome regularity in scoring 8 sixes, the most from one batsman
in any World Cup match at the time. The final Australian total of 359 (2
wickets, 50 overs), at a run rate of 7.18 runs an over, was their then
second highest ever in ODI history.</p>
<p>India's run chase was made even more difficult after their trump card,
Sachin Tendulkar, was out in the first over after skying a pull shot,
Glenn McGrath completing the caught and bowled. Nevertheless,
Virender Sehwag's (82 from 81 balls, 10 fours, 3 sixes) run-a-ball half
century gave India respectability as they maintained a high scoring
rate. Their only realistic hope—a washout—looked a possibility as the
game was interrupted by rain with India at 3/103 after 17 overs.
However, this rain passed by, and India's hopes were dashed when
Sehwag was run out by Darren Lehmann, and again when Rahul Dravid
(47 from 57 balls, 2 fours) was bowled by Andy Bichel, ending their
partnership of 88 runs in 13.2 overs. India's batsmen continued to
throw wickets away in the chase as the run rate crept up past 7 an
over, and they were finally bowled out for 234 (all out, 39.2 overs) at a
run rate of 5.97 runs an over giving Australia an emphatic victory by a
record margin (in World Cup finals thus far) of 125 runs, underlining
their dominance of the tournament. Ponting was named "Man of the
Match", and Sachin Tendulkar was named "Player of the Series."</p>

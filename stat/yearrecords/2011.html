		<h3>memories</h3>
		
        <p>The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was the tenth Cricket World Cup. It
was played in India, Sri Lanka, and (for the first time) Bangladesh.
India won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final
in Mumbai, thus becoming the first country to win the Cricket World
Cup final on home soil. India's Yuvraj Singh was declared the man
of the tournament. This was the first time in World Cup history that
two Asian teams had appeared in the final. It was also the first time
since the 1992 World Cup that the final match did not feature
Australia.</p>
<p>All the matches were One Day Internationals, and all were played over
50 overs. Fourteen national cricket teams took part, including 10 full
members and four associate members of the ICC. The opening
ceremony was held on 17 February 2011 at Bangabandhu National
Stadium, Dhaka, and the tournament was played between 19
February and 2 April. The first match was played between India and
Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka.
Pakistan was also scheduled to be a co-host, but after the 2009 attack
on the Sri Lanka national cricket team in Lahore, the International
Cricket Council (ICC) cancelled that, and the headquarters of the
organising committee, originally in Lahore, was transferred to
Mumbai. Pakistan was to have held 14 matches, including one
semi-final. Eight of the games (including the semi-final) were
awarded to India, four to Sri Lanka, and two to Bangladesh.</p>
<h3>Controversies</h3>
<p>Bangladeshi fans threw rocks at the West Indies team bus as it
returned players to their hotel after their win over Bangladesh in Dhaka
on 4 March. It was later claimed that the rock-throwers had confused
the bus with the Bangladesh team bus. The elite Rapid Action
Battalion of Bangladesh arrested 38 people after the attack, and the
West Indies later received an apology.</p>
<p>The political party Shiv Sena threatened to disrupt the final in
Mumbai if the Pakistani team qualified.</p>
<p>During the group stage match between India and England, Ian Bell
was given not out for leg before wicket despite the ball hitting him in
line with the wickets and being on a path to hit the stumps. India
captain MS Dhoni referred the decision to the TV umpire, who
confirmed the original decision as the ball had struck Bell at a point
more than 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) from the stumps, a point at which the
reliability of the Hawk-Eye system diminishes below acceptable levels.
Dhoni later complained that the rule had deprived his side of what
seemed like an obvious wicket. The rules were subsequently revised
and the umpires were given new guidelines. The Sri Lankan captain,
Kumar Sangakkara, later criticised the decision to alter the 2.5-metre
rule while a tournament was in progress.</p>
<p>In the final between India and Sri Lanka, loud crowd noise prevented
match referee Jeff Crowe from hearing Sri Lankan captain
Sangakkara's call as the coin was tossed by Indian captain Dhoni. The
toss had to be redone  (an extremely unusual event, especially at as
prominent an event as the World Cup final.)</p>

		<h3>memories</h3>
		
           <p>The 1979 Cricket World Cup (officially the Prudential World Cup) was the second edition of the tournament and<br />
		   was won by the West Indies. It was held from 9 to 23 June 1979 in England. The format had remained unchanged<br />
		   from 1975. Eight countries participated in the event. The preliminary matches were played in 2 groups of 4 each.<br />
		   The top two teams in each group played the semifinals, whose winners played the final.</p>
<p>The matches played consisted of 60 overs per team and were played in
traditional white clothing and with red balls. They were all played
during the day and hence started early.</p>
<p>The Prudential Cup was lifted by Clive Lloyd, captain of the West Indies
who started as the favourites to win the cup again. There was no 'Man
of the Series' awarded in 1979.</p>
<h3>Final</h3><p>23 June 1979</p><p>England won the toss and chose to field first. The West Indies got off
to a bad start, falling to 99/4 with the loss of Greenidge, Haynes,
Kallicharan, and captain Clive Lloyd. However, Vivian Richards (138
from 157 balls, 11 fours, 3 sixes) and Collis King (86 from 66 balls, 10
fours, 3 sixes) consolidated the innings. King especially ripped through
the English bowling, with a strike rate of 130.3. The West Indies were
already at 238/5 when the 139 run partnership ended with the loss of
Collis King. Vivian Richards and the tail then took the West Indies to a
very imposing total of 286 (9 wickets, 60 overs).</p>
<p>The English batsmen got off to a good start. But the openers, Mike
Brearley (64 from 130 balls, 7 fours) and Geoff Boycott (57 from 105
balls, 3 fours) scored very slowly. They put together a very methodical
opening partnership of 129 runs in 38 overs, playing as if the match
were a five-day Test. By the time both batsmen were out, the required
run rate had risen too high. Graham Gooch played some hefty strokes
in scoring his 32, taking England to 183/2. However, the loss of Gooch
triggered the most devastating collapse in World Cup history, as
England lost 8/11. They were eventually all out for 194 in 51 overs.
Vivian Richards was declared Man of the Match.

Canada were the only two teams without Test status and qualified for
the tournament by reaching the final of the 1979 ICC Trophy.</p>

         <p>The 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup, the seventh edition of the
tournament, was hosted primarily by England, with some games being
hosted in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and the Netherlands. The World Cup
was won by Australia, who beat Pakistan by 8 wickets at Lord's Cricket
Ground in London. New Zealand and South Africa were the other
semi-finalists.</p>
<p>The 12 contesting teams were divided into two groups; each team
played all the others in their group during the league stage. The top
three from each group advanced to the Super Sixes, a new concept for
the 1999 World Cup, where each qualifier from group A played each
qualifier from group B. The teams also carried forward their points
from the games against the other qualifiers from their group. The top
four in the Super Sixes contested the semi-finals.</p>

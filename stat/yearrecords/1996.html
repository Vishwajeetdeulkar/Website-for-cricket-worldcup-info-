         <p>The 1996 Cricket World Cup, also called the Wills World Cup after its
official sponsors, ITC's Wills brand, was the sixth Cricket World Cup,
organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was the second
World Cup to be hosted by Pakistan and India, and for the first time by
Sri Lanka. The tournament was won by Sri Lanka, who defeated
Australia in the final at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Punjab,
Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Wills World Cup was played in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Controversy dogged the tournament before any games were played;
Australia and the West Indies refused to send their teams to Sri Lanka
following the Central Bank bombing by the Tamil Tigers in January
1996. Sri Lanka, in addition to offering maximum security to the teams,
questioned the validity of citing security concerns when the
International Cricket Council had determined it was safe. After
extensive negotiations, the ICC ruled that Sri Lanka would be awarded
both games on forfeit. As a result of this decision, Sri Lanka
automatically qualified for the quarter-finals before playing a game.</p>
<p><h3>Final</h3></p><p>17 March 1996</p>
<p>Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to field. Mark Taylor (74 from 83
balls, 8 fours, 1 six) and Ricky Ponting (45 from 73 balls, 2 fours)
shared a second-wicket partnership of 101 runs. When Ponting and
Taylor were dismissed, however, Australia fell from 1/137 to 5/170 as
the famed 4-pronged spin attack of Sri Lanka took its toll. Despite the
slump, Australia struggled on to 241 (7 wickets, 50 overs).</p>
<h3>format</h3>
<p>All the test playing countries participated in the competition including
Zimbabwe who following the last world cup became the 9th Full Test
status member of the ICC. The Three Associate teams to qualify
through the 1994 ICC Trophy also made their World Cup debuts in
1996: the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands and Kenya. The
Netherlands lost all of their five matches while the U.A.E. only beat the
Dutch. Kenya, however, recorded a surprise victory over the West
Indies in Pune.</p>
<p>India hosted 17 matches at 17 different venues, while Pakistan hosted
16 matches at 6 venues and Sri Lanka hosted 4 matches at 3 venues.</p>
<p>It was the first time a tournament host or co-host had won the
cricket World Cup.</p>

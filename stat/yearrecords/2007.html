        <p> The 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup was the 9th edition of the Cricket
World Cup tournament that took place in the West Indies from 13
March to 28 April 2007, using the sport's One Day International
format. There were a total of 51 matches played, three fewer than at
the 2003 World Cup (despite a field larger by two teams).</p>
<p>The 16 competing teams were initially divided into four groups, with
the two best-performing teams from each group moving on to a "Super
8" format. From this, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South
Africa won through to the semi-finals, with Australia defeating Sri
Lanka in the final to win their third consecutive World Cup and their
fourth overall. Australia's unbeaten record in the tournament increased
their total to 29 consecutive World Cup matches without loss, a streak
dating back to 23 May 1999, during the group stage of the 1999 World
Cup. The tournament also saw upsets in the first round with
tournament favourites India and Pakistan failing to making it past the
group stage while Bangladesh, the lowest-ranked Test playing nation,
and Ireland, an associate (non-test playing) nation, made it to the
Super 8s.</p>
<p>Following the tournament the ICC distributed surplus tournament
revenues of US$239 million to its members.</p>
<p><h3>Final</h3>
<p>This was the first World Cup final to be a repeat : the sides previously
met in the 1996 World Cup final, which Sri Lanka won. Australia had
won every World Cup match against Sri Lanka apart from that loss.
The match was Sri Lanka's second World Cup final appearance and
Australia's sixth, their fourth in a row. Ricky Ponting won the toss and
elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and
the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Adam Gilchrist played an
incredible innings of 149  the highest for any batsman in a World Cup
final  to give Australia an imposing total going in at the break.</p>
<p>While Sri Lankan batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya
were adding 116 for the second wicket, the contest was alive, but after
the pair got out, Sri Lanka's chances slowly diminished. Further
rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with
the target revised to 269. At the end of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka
still trailing the adjusted Duckworth-Lewis target by 37 runs, the
umpires suspended the game due to bad light. While Australia's
players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs
had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because
the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three
overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka
needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Mahela Jayawardene agreed there
was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to
resume batting, with Ricky Ponting agreeing to play only spinners. The
umpires later apologised for their error: the match should have ended
then with Australia winning by 37 runs. The last three overs were
played in almost complete darkness, during which Sri Lanka added just
nine runs, giving Australia a 53-run victory by the D-L method, as Sri
Lanka had batted two overs fewer than they had.</p>

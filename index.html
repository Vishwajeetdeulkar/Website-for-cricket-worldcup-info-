             <h2>ABOUT WORLD CUP</h2></p>
 			<p>The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by 
			<br />the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a 
			<br />finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the "flagship event of the
			<br />international cricket calendar" by the ICC.</p>

 <p>The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years
 <br />earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a
<br /> tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was
<br /> played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament
<br /> onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted
<br /> at least one match in the tournament.</p>
<p>
The finals of the World Cup are contested by the ten full members of the ICC (all of which are Test-playing teams) and a number of
 <br />teams made up from associate and affiliate members of the ICC, selected via the World Cricket League and a later qualifying 
<br />tournament. A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the 2015
<br /> tournament. Australia has won the tournament five times, with the West Indies, India (twice each), Pakistan and Sri Lanka (once each)
<br /> also having won the tournament. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the
<br /> 2003 tournament.
